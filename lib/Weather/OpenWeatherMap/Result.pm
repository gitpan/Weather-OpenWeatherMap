=head1 NAME

Weather::OpenWeatherMap::Result - Weather lookup result superclass

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Normally retrieved via Weather::OpenWeatherMap

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the parent class for L<Weather::OpenWeatherMap> weather results.

The L</"SEE ALSO"> section links known subclasses.

=head2 ATTRIBUTES

=head3 data

This is the decoded hash from the attached L</json> (as a
L<List::Objects::WithUtils::Hash>).

Subclasses provide more convenient accessors for retrieving desired
information.

=head3 error

The error message received from the OpenWeatherMap backend (or the empty
string if there was no error).

See also: L</is_success>, L</response_code>

=head3 is_success

Returns boolean true if the OpenWeatherMap backend returned a successful
response.

See also: L</error>, L</response_code>

=head3 json

The raw JSON this Result was created with.

=head3 response_code

The response code from OpenWeatherMap.

See also: L</is_success>, L</error>

=head3 request

The original request that was attached to this result.

=head2 METHODS

=head3 new_for

Factory method; returns a new object belonging to the appropriate subclass:

  my $result = Weather::OpenWeatherMap::Result->new_for(
    Forecast =>
      request => $orig_request,
      json    => $raw_json,
  );

=head3 decode_json

Result deserialization wrapper for use by subclasses.

=head3 encode_json

Serialization wrapper for use by subclasses.
